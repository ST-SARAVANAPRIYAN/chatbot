ðŸš¦ BOT CREATION ROADMAP (Start-to-End)
âœ… PHASE 1: Basic Chatbot with Semantic Search
Goal: Make the chatbot smart enough to search your website content and answer questions.

ðŸ”¹ STEP 1: Setup the Environment
Install Python & necessary libraries (LlamaIndex, ChromaDB, gemini).

Get your gemini API key.

ðŸ”¹ STEP 2: Prepare the Content
Collect content from your web portal:

Static pages (FAQs, product pages, policies)

Save them as text files (e.g., .txt, .md, .html)

Store them in a folder like data/.

ðŸ”¹ STEP 3: Build the Semantic Index
Use LlamaIndex to:

Load your content

Chunk it into paragraphs

Convert it into searchable embeddings

Store these embeddings in a vector database (like ChromaDB).

ðŸ”¹ STEP 4: Create the Chatbot
Accept user questions in a chat interface (CLI, web UI, etc.)

Convert the question into a vector

Search the vector DB for similar chunks

Send the retrieved content + question to the LLM (GPT-4o)

Return the answer to the user

âœ… PHASE 2: Add Knowledge Graph (Optional but Powerful)
Goal: Add accurate answers for structured/fact-based questions.

ðŸ”¹ STEP 5: Extract Entities & Relationships
From your content, extract:

Products, features, policies, people, etc.

How they are connected (e.g., Product -> hasWarranty -> 1 year)

Tools: Spacy, LLMs, rule-based patterns

ðŸ”¹ STEP 6: Build and Store the Graph
Create a Knowledge Graph Database (Neo4j, ArangoDB, or similar)

Store your facts as nodes and relationships

ðŸ”¹ STEP 7: Add Routing Logic (Hybrid RAG)
When a question comes in:

If it's factual â†’ query the graph

If it's vague/open-ended â†’ use semantic search

If unsure â†’ do both and combine answers

Pass results to the LLM to form a complete answer

âœ… PHASE 3: Polish and Expand
ðŸ”¹ STEP 8: Add Feedback + Monitoring
Let users rate answers

Track common questions

Log failed or unclear queries

ðŸ”¹ STEP 9: Deploy the Chatbot
Use Streamlit, Gradio, or a web frontend to host the chatbot

Deploy on cloud (Vercel, AWS, GCP, etc.)

ðŸ”¹ STEP 10: Auto-Update Content
Setup scripts or webhooks to fetch new portal content

Re-index new pages regularly
